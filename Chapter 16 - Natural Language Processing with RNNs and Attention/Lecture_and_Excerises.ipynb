    "A common approach for natural language tasks is to use recurrent neural networks. We will therefore continue to explore RNNs, starting with a *character RNN*, trained to predict the next character in a sentence. We will first use a *stateless RNN* (which learns on random portions of text at each iteration, without any information on the rest of the text), then we will build a *stateful RNN* (which preserves the hidden state between training iterations and continues reading where it left off, allowing it to learn longer patterns). Next, we will build an RNN to perform sentiment analysis (e.g., reading movie reviews and extracting the rater's feeling about the movie), this time treating sentences as sequences of words, rather than characters. Then we will show how RNNs can be used to build an Encoder-Decoder architecture capable of performing neural machine translation (NMT). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second part of this chapter, we look at *attention mechanisms*. As their name suggests, these are neural network components that learn to select the part of the inputs that the rest of the model should focus on at each time step. First, we will see how to boost the performance of an RNN-based Encoder-Decoder architecture using attention, then we will drop RNNs altogether and look at a very successful attention-only architecture called the *Transformer*"

    "When dealing with time series, you would in general split across time: for example, you might take the years 2000 to 2012 for the training set, the years 2013 to 2015 for the validation set, and the years 2016 to 2018 for the test set. However, in some cases you may be able to split along other dimensions, which will give you a longer time period to train on. For example, if you have data about the financial health of 10,000 companies from 2000 to 2018, you might be able to split this data across the different companies. It's very likely that many of these companies will be strongly correlated, though (e.g. whole economic sectors may go up or down jointly), and if you have correlated companies across the training set and the test set your test set will not be as useful, as its measure of the generalization error will be optimistically biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it is often safer to split across time - but this implicitly assumes that the patterns the RNN can learn in the past (in the training set) will still exist in the future. In other words, we assume that the time series is *stationary* (at least in a wide sense). For many time series this assumption is reasonable (e.g. chemical reactions should be fine, since the laws of chemistry don't change every day), but for many others it is not (e.g. financial markets are notoriously not stationary since patterns disappear as soon as traders spot them and start exploiting them). **To make sure the time series is indeed sufficiently stationary, you can plot the model's errors on the validation set across time: if the model performs much better on the first part of the validation set than on the last part, then the time series may not be stationary enough, and you might be better off training the model on a shorter time span.**\n",

    "In short, spiltting a time series into a training set, a validation set, and a test set is not a trivial task, and how it's done will depend strongly on the task at hand."

    "The IMDb reviews dataset is the \"hello world\" of natural language processing. The IMDb reviews dataset is popular for good reasons: it is simple enough to be tackled in a short amount of time, but challenging enough to be fun and rewarding. Keras provides a simple function to load it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is already preprocessed for you: **X_train consists of a list of reviews, each of which is represented as a NumPy array of integers, where each integer represents a word. All punctuation was removed, and then words were converted to lowercase, split by spaces, and finally indexed by frequency (so low integers correspond to frequent words).** The integers 0, 1, and 2 are special: they represent the padding token, the *start-of-sequence* (SSS) token, and unknown words, respectively. If you want to visualize a review, you can decode it like in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real project, you will have to preprocess the text yourself. When encoding words, it filters out a lot of characters, including most punctuation, line breaks, and tabs (but you can change this by setting the ***filters*** argument). Most importantly, it uses spaces to identify word boundaries. This is OK for English and many other scripts that use spaces between words, but not all scripts use spaces this way. Chinese does not use spaces between words, Vietnamese uses spaces even within words, and languages such as German often attach multiple words together, without spaces.\n",

    "Fortunatley, there are better options! The 2018 paper by Taku Kudo \"Subword Regularization: Improving Neural Network Translation Models with Multiple Subword Candidates\" introduced an unsupervised learning techinque to tokenize and detokenize text at the subword level in a language-independent way, treating spaces like other characters. With this approach, even if your model encounters a word it has never seen before, it can still reasonably guess what it means. Google's *SentencePiece* project provides an open source implementation of this paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, the Tensorflow team released the TF.Text library in June 2019, which implements various tokenization strategies, including WordPiece (a variant of byte pair encoding).\n",

    "If you want to deploy your model to a mobile device or a web browser, and you don't want to have to write a different preprocessing function every time, then you will want to handle preprocessing using only TensorFlow operations, so it can be included in the model itself. An exmple of this is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "TF Transform (introduced in Chapter 13) provides some useful functions to handle such vocabularies. For example, check out the tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary() function: it will go through the dataset to find all distinct words and build the vocabulary, and it will generate the TF operations required to encode each word using this vocabulary.\n",

    "As it stands, the model will need to learn that the padding tokens should be ignored. Why don't we tell the model to ignore the padding tokens, so that it can focus on the data that actually matters? It's actually quite trivial: simply add mask_zero=True when creating the Embedding Layer. This means that padding tokens (whose ID is 0) will be ignored by all downstream layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way this works is that the Embedding layer creates a *mask tensor* equal to K.not_equal(inputs, 0) (where K = keras.backend): it is a Boolean tensor with the same shape as the inputs, and it is equal to False anywhere ther word IDs are 0, or True otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each layer may handle the mask differently, but in general they simply ignore masked time steps (i.e. time steps for which the mask is False). The LSTM and GRU layers have an optimized implementation for GPUs, based on Nvidia's cdDNN library. However, this implementation does not support masking. If your model uses a mask, then these layers will fall back to the (much slower) default implementation. Note that the optimized implementation also requires you to use the default values for several hyperparameters: activation, recurrent_activation, recurrent_dropout, unroll, use_bias, and reset_after.\n",
    "\n",
    "All layers that receive the mask must support masking. Any layer that supports masking must have a supports_masking attribute equal to True. If you want to implement your own custom layer with masking support, you should add a mask argument to the call() method (and obviously make the method use the mask somehow ). Additionally, you should set self.supports_masking=True in the constructor. If your layer does not start with an Embedding layer, you may use the keras.layers.Masking layer instead: it sets the mask to K.any(K.not_equal(inputs, 0), axis=-1), meaning that time steps where the last dimension is full of zeros will be masked out in subsequent layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using masking layers and automatic mask propagation works best for simple Sequential models. It will not always work for more complex models, such as when you need to mix Conv1D layers with recurrent layers. In such cases, you will need to explicitly compute the mask and pass it to the appropriate layers, using either the Functional API or the Subclassing API. For example, the following model is identical to the previous model, except it is built using the Functional API and handles masking manually.\n",

For the very first word, it is given the start-of-sequence (SOS) token. The decoder is expected to end the sentence with an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. Note that the English sentences are reversed before they are fed to the encoder. For exapmle, \"I drink milk\" is reversed to \"milk drink I\". This ensures that the beginning of the English sentence will be fed last to the encoder, which is useful because that's generally the first thing that the decoder needs to translate.\n",

At each step, the decoder outputs a score for each word in the output vocabulary (i.e French), and then the softmax layer turns these scores into probabilities. The word with the highest probability is output. This is very much like a regular classification task, so you can train the model using the \"sparse_categorical_crossentropy\" loss. Note that at inference time (after training), you will not have the target sentence to feed to the decoder. Instead, simply feed the decoder the word that it output at the previous step. "

Since regular tensors have fixed shapes, they can only contain sentences of the same length. You can use masking to handle this, as discussed earlier. However, if the sentences have very different lengths, you can't just crop them like we did for sentiment analysis (because we want full translations). Instead, group sentences into buckets of similar lengths using padding for the shorter sequences to ensure all sentences in a bucket have the same length (check out the tf.data.experimental.bucket_by_sequence_length() function)\n",

    "> When the output vocabulary is large (which is the case here), outputting a probability for each and every possible word would be terribly slow. To avoid this, one solution is to look only at the logits output by the model for the correct word and for a random sample of incorrect words, then compute an approximation of the loss based only on these logits. This *sampled softmax* technique was introduced in 2015. In TensorFlow you can use the tf.nn.sampled_softmax_loss() function for this during training and use the normal softmax function at inference time (sampled softmax cannot be used at inference because it requires the target)."

    "The TensorFlow Addons project includes many sequence-to-sequence tools to let you easily build production-ready Encoder-Decoders. The code is mostly self-explanatory, but there are a few points to note. First, we set return_state=True when creating the LSTM layer so that we can get its final hidden state and pass it to the decoder. Since we are using an LSTM cell, it actually returns two hidden states (short term and long term). The TrainingSampler is one of several samplers available in TensorFlow Addons: their role is to tell the decoder at each step what it should pretend the previous output was. During inference, this should be the embedding of the token that was actually output. During training, it should be the embedding of the previous target token: this is why we used the TrainingSampler. In practice, it is often a good idea to start training with the embedding of the target of the previous time step and gradually transition to using the embedding of the actual token that was output at the previous step. The ScheduledEmbeddingTrainingSampler will randomly choose between the target or the actual output, with a probability that you can gradually change during training."

By greedily outputting the most likely word at every step, it ended up with a suboptimal translation. How can we give the model a chance to go back and fix mistakes it made earlier? One of the most common solutions is *beam search*: it keeps track of a short list of the k most promising sentences (say, the top three), and at each decoder step it tries to extend them by one word, keeping only the k most likely sentences. The parameter k is called the *beam width*. We can boost our Encoder-Decoder model's performance without any extra training simply by using it more wisely.

    "We first create a BeamSearchDecoder, which wraps all the decoder clones (in this case 10 clones). Then we create one copy of the encoder's final state for each decoder clone, and we pass these states to the decoder, along with the start and end tokens. With all this, you can get good translations for fairly short sentences. Unfortunately, this model will be really bad at translating long sentences. Once again, the problem comes from the limited short-term memory of RNNs. *Attention mechanisms* are the game-changing innovation that addressed this problem."

    "In a groundbreaking 2014 paper by Dzmitry Bahdanau et al they introduced a technique that allowed the decoder to focus on the appropriate words (as encoded by the encoder) at each time step. This means that the path from an input word to its translation is now much shorter, so the short-term memory limitations of RNNs have much less impact. Attention mechanisms revolutionized neural machine translation (and NLP in general), allowing a significant imrprovement in the state of art, especially for long sentences (over 30 words.).\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, the decoder's memory cell computes a weighted sum of all these encoder outputs: this determines which words it will focus on at this step. The weight $\\alpha_{(t,j)}$ is the weight of the $i^{th}$ encoder ouptut at the $t^{th}$ decoder time step. For example, if the weight $\\alpha_{(3, 2)}$ is much larger than the weights $\\alpha_{(3, 0)}$ and $\\alpha_{(3, 1)}$, then the decoder will pay much more attention to word number 2 (\"milk\") than to the other two words, at least at this time step. The rest of the decoder works just like earlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "But where do these $\\alpha_{(t,j)}$ weights come from? It's actually pretty simple: they are generated by a type of small neural network called an *alignment model* (or an *attention layer*), which is trained jointly with the rest of the Encoder-Decoder model. This time-distributed Dense layer with a single neuron, which receives as input all the encoder outputs, concatenated with the decoder's previous hidden state The layer outputs a score (or energy) for reach encoder output: this score measures how well each output is aligned wit hteh decoder's previous hidden state. Finally, all the scores go through a softmax layer to get a final weight for each encoder output. All the weights for a given decoder time step add up to 1. This particular attention mechanism is called *Bahdanau attention*. Since it concatenates the encoder output with the decoder's previous hidden state, it is sometimes called *concatenative attention* or *additive attention*.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Recall that a time-distributed Dense layer is equiavalent to a regular Dense layer that you apply independently at each time step (only much faster)*** \n",
    "\n",
    "If the input sentence is n words long, and assuming the output sentence is about as long, then this model will need to compute about $n^2$ weights. Fortunately, this quadratic computational complexity is still tractable because even long sentences don't have thousands of words. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another common attention mechanism was proposed shortly after in a 2015 paper. Because the goal of the attention mechanism is to measure the similarity between one of the encoder's outputs and the decoder's previous hidden state, the authors proposed to simply compute the dot product of these two vectors, as this is often a fairly good similarity measure, and model hardware can compute it much faster. For this to be possible, both vectors must have the same dimensionality. This is called *Luong attention*, or sometimes *multiplicative attention*. The dot product gives a score, and all the scores (at a given decoder time step) go through a softmax layer to give the final weights, just like the Bahdanau attention. Another simplification they proposed was to use the decoder's hidden state at the current step rather than at the previous time step, then to use the output of the attention mechanism directly to compute the decoder's predictions (rather than using it to compute the decoder's current hidden state). They also proposed a variant of the dot product mechanism where the encoder outputs first go through a linear transformation (i.e. a time-distributed Dense layer without a bias term) before the dot products are computed. This is called the \"general\" dot product approach. They compared both dot product approaches to the concatenative attention mechanism (adding a rescaling parameter vector **v**), and they observed that the dot product variants performed better than concatenative attention. For this reason, concatenative attention is much less used now. "

One of their applications beyond NMT was in generating image captions using visual attention: a convolutional neural network first processes the image and outputs some feature maps, then a decoder RNN equipped with an attention mechanism generates the caption, one word at a time. At each decoder time step (each word), the decoder uses the attention model to focus on just the right part of the image.** Attention mechanisms are so powerful that you can actually build state-of-the-art models using only attention mechanisms."

As an extra bonus, this architecture was also much faster to train and easier to parallelize, so they managed to train it at a fraction of the time and cost of the previous state-of-the-art models. Let's look a bit closer at both of the novel compenents of the Transformer architecture, starting with positional embeddings."

    "**A positional embedding is a dense vector that encodes the position of a word within the sentence**: the $i^{th}$ positional embedding is simply added to the word embedding of the $i^{th}$ word in the sentence. These positional embeddings can be learned by the model, but in the paper the authors preferred to use fixed positional embeddings, defined using the sine and cosine functions of different frequencies. This solution gives the same performance as learned positional embeddings do, but it can extend to arbitrarily long sentences, which is why it's favored. After the positional embeddings are added to the word embeddings, the rest of the model has access to the absolute position of each word in the sentence because there is a unique positional embedding for each position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the choice of oscillating functions makes it possible for the model to learn relative positions as well. For example, words located 38 words apart (e.g. at positions p = 22 and = 60) always have the same positional embedding values in the embedding dimensions. **This explains why we need both the sine and cosine for each frequency: if we only use the sine, the model would not be able to distinguish positions p = 25 and p = 35**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no PositionalEmbedding layer in TensorFlow, but it is easy to create one. For efficiency reasons, we precompute the positional embedding matrix in the constructor (so we need to know the maximum sentnece length, max_steps, and the number of dimensions for each word representation, max_dims). Then the call() method crops the embedding matrix to the size of the inputs, and it adds it to the inputs. Since we added an extra first dimension of size 1 when creating the positional embedding matrix, the rules of broadcasting will ensure that hte matrix gets added to every sentence in the inputs. Next we look deeper into the heart of the Transformer model: The Multi-Head Attention layer."

The model does not have discrete tokens to represent the keys (like \"subject\" or \"verb\"); it has vectorized representations of these concepts (which it learned during training), so they key it will use for the lookup (called the *query*) will not perfectly match any key in the dictionary.

    "Now it's time to look at the final piece of the puzzle: **What is a Multi-Head Attention layer? It is just a bunch of Scaled Dot-Product Attention layers, each preceded by a linear transformation of the values, keys, and queries (i.e., a time-distributed Dense layer with no activation function). All the outputs are simply concatenated, and they go through a final linear transformation (again, time-distributed). But why?** What is the intuition behind this architecture? Well, consider the word \"played\" we discussed earlier. The encoder was smart enough to encode the fact that it is a verb. But the word representation also includes its position in the text, thanks to the positional encodings, and it probably includes many other features that are useful for its translation, such as the fact that it is in the past tense. **In short, the word representation encodes many different characteristics of the word. If we just used a single Scaled Dot-Product Attention layer, we would only be able to query all of these characteristics in one shot. This is why the Multi-Head Attention layer applies multiple different linear transformations of the values, keys, and queries: this allows the model to apply many different projections of the word representation into different subspaces, each focusing on a subset of the word's characteristics.** Perhpas one of the linear layers will project the word representation into a subspace where all that remains is the information that the word is a verb, another linear layer will extract just the fact that it is past tense, and so on. Then the Scaled Dot-Product Attention layers implement the lookup phase, and finally we concatenate all the results and project them back to the original space."

Their model outperformed the state of the art, reducing the error by 18-24% in most cases. Moreover, they showed that by fine-tuning the pretrained model on just 100 labeled examples, they could achieve the same performance as a model trained from scratch on 10,000 examples.<br><br>\n",

Just a few months later, in February 2019, Alec Radford, Jeffrey Wu, and other OpenAI researchers published the GPT-2 paper, which proposed a very similar architecture but larger still (with over 1.5 billion parameters!) and they showed that it could achieve **good performance on many tasks without any fine-tuning.

    "#### How it works (high level)\n",
    "\n",
    "For each step (or token), the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Computes a **score** between the current state and each input token representation\n",
    "2. Converts scores into **weights** (usually with softmax)\n",
    "3. Takes a **weighted sum** of the input representations\n",
    "4. Uses that context vector to make the next prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it helps\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Handles long sequences better** (less bottleneck than one fixed-size context vector)\n",
    "* **Improves performance** in translation, summarization, captioning, etc.\n",
    "* **Makes alignment more explicit** (you can inspect attention weights)\n",
    "* **Enables parallelism in Transformers** (via self-attention)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types (quickly)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encoder-decoder attention**: decoder attends to encoder outputs\n",
    "* **Self-attention**: tokens attend to other tokens in the same sequence (core of Transformers)\n",
