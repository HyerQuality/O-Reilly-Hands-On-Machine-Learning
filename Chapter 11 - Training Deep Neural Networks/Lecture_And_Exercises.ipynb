As a result, the Gradient Descent update leaves the lower layers' connection weights virtually unchanged, and the training never converges to a good solution. We call this the *vanishing gradients* problem. More generally, deep neural networks suffer from unstable gradients; different layers may learn at widely different speeds.\n",

For the signal to flow properly, the authors argue that we need the variance of the outputs of each layer to be equal to the variance of its inputs, and we need the gradients to have equal variance before and after flowing through a layer in the reverse direction. It is actually not possible to guarantee both, but Glorot and Bengio proposed *Xavier initialization or Glorot initialization*\n",

    "One of the insights in the 2010 paper by Glorot and Bengio was that the problems with unstable gradients were in part due to a poor choice of activation functions. It turns out that other activations behave much better in deep neural networks-- in particular, the ReLU activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the ReLU activiation function is not perfect. It suffers from a problem known as the *dying ReLUs*: during training, some neurons effectively \"die\", meaning they stop outputting anything other than 0. To solve this problem, you may want to use a variant of the ReLU function such as the *leaky ReLU*. The hyperparameter $\\alpha$ defines how much the function \"leaks\": it is the slope of the function for z < 0 and is typically set to 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2015 paper compared several variants of the ReLU activiation function, and one of its conclusions was that the leaky variants always outperformed the strict ReLU activation function. In fact, setting $\\alpha$ = 0.2 (a huge leak) seemed to result in better performance than $\\alpha$ = 0.01 (a small leak).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Randomized leaky ReLU (RReLU)*, where $\\alpha$ is selected at random, performed fairly well and seemed to act as a regularizer. Finally, the paper evaluated the *parametric leaky ReLU (PReLU)*, where $\\alpha$ is authorized to be learned during training (instead of being a hyperparameter, it becomes a parameter that can be modified by backpropagation like any other parameter). **PReLU was reported to strongly outperform ReLU on large image datasets, but on smaller datasets it runs the risk of overfitting the training set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Last but not least, **a 2015 paper proposed a new activation function called the *exponential linear unit (ELU)* that outperformed all the ReLU variants** in the authors' experiments: training time was reduced and the neural network performed better on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ELU activation function looks a lot like the ReLU function, with a few major differences: <br>\n",
    "1. It takes on negative values when z < 0, which allows the unit to have an average output closer to 0 and helps alleviate the vanishing gradients problem. The hyperparameter $\\alpha$ defines the value that the ELU function approaches when z is a large negative number. It is usually set to 1, but you can tweak it like any other hyperparameter. <br><br>\n",
    "2. It has a nonzero gradient for z < 0, which avoids the dead neurons problem. <br><br>\n",
    "3. If $\\alpha$ is equal to 1 then the function is smooth everywhere, including around z = 0, which helps speed up Gradient Descent since it does not bounce as much to the left and right of z = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**The main drawback of the ELU activiation function is that it is slower to compute than the ReLU function and its variants** (due to the use of the exponential function). Its faster convergence rate during training compensates for that slow computation, but still, at test time an ELU network will be slower than a ReLU network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, a 2017 paper introduced the *Scaled ELU (SELU)* activation function: as its named suggests, it is a scaled variant of the ELU activation function. The authors showed that if you build a neural network composed exclusively of a stack of dense layers, and if all hidden layers use the SELU activation function, then the network will *self-normalize*: the output of each layer will tend to preserve a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 during training, which solves the vanishing/exploding gradients problem. There are, however, a few conditions for self-normalization to happen: <br>\n",
    "1. The input features must be standardized (mean 0 and standard deviations 1) <br><br>\n",
    "2. Every hidden layer's weights must be initialized with LeCun normal initialization. In Keras, this means setting kernel_initializer='lecun_normal'<br><br>\n",
    "3. The network's architecture must be sequential. **Unfortunately, if you try to use SELU in nonsequential architectures, such as recurrent networks or networks with skip connections (i.e. connections that skip layers, such as in Wide & Deep nets), self-normalization will not be guaranteed, so SELU will not necessarily outperform other activation functions.**<br><br>\n",
    "4. The paper only guarantees self-normalization if all layers are dense, but some researchers have noted that the SELU activation function can improve performance in convolutional neural nets as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "***So, which activation should you use for the hidden layers of your deep neural networks?*** Although your mileage will vary, in general **SELU > ELU > leaky ReLU (and its variants) > ReLU > tanh > logistic**. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the network's architecture prevents its from self-normalizing, then ELU may perform better than SELU (since SELU is not smooth at z = 0). If you care a lot about runtime latency, then you may prefer leaky ReLU. If you don't want to tweak yet another hyperparameter, you may use the default $\\alpha$ values used by Keras (e.g., 0.3 for leaky ReLU). If you ahve spare time and computing power, you can use cross-validation to evaluate other activation functions, such as RReLU if your network is overfitting or PReLU if you have a huge training set. **That said, because ReLU is the most used activation function (by far), may libraries and hardware accelerators provide ReLU-specific optimizations; therefore, if speed is your priority, ReLU might still be the best choice.**"

    "Although using He initialization along with ELU (or any variant of ReLU) can significantly reduce the danger of the vanishing/exploding gradients problems at the beginning of training, it doesn't guarantee that they won't come bak during training. *Batch Normalization (BN)* addresses these problems. The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before or after the activation function of each hidden layer. **This operation simply zero-centers and normalizes each input, then scales and shifts the result using two new parameter vectors per layer: one for scaling, the other for shifting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and mean of each of the layer's inputs. In many cases, if you add a BN layer as the very first layer of your neural network, you do not need to standardize your training set (e.g. using StandardScaler); the BN layer will do it for you (well, approximately, since it only looks at one batch at a time, and it can also rescale and shift each input feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunatley, its not that simple. We may need to make predictions for individuals instances rather than for batches of instances. Moreover, even if we do have a batch of instances, it may be too small, or the instances may not be independent and identically distributed, so computing statistics over the batch instances would be unreliable. \n",
    "\n",
    "One solution could be to wait until the end of training, then run the whole training set through the neural network and compute the mean and standard deviation of each input of the BN layer. These \"final\" input means and standard deviations could then be used instead of the batch input means and standard deviations when making predictions. **However, most implementations of Batch Normalization estimate these final statistics during training by using a moving average of the layer's input means and standard deviations. This is what Keras does automatically when you use the BatchNormalization layer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Ioffe and Szegedy demonstrated that Batch Normalization considerably improved all the deep neural networks they experiments with. The vanishing gradients problem was strongly reduced to the point that they could use saturating activation functions such as the tanh and even logistic activation function. The networks were also much less sensitive to the weight initialization. The authors were able to use much larger learning rates as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically they note that:\n",
    "    * Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result of ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5 validation error (4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, like a gift that keeps on giving, Batch Normalization acts like a regularizer, reducing the need for other regularization techniques (such as dropout). \n",
    "\n",
    "Batch Normalization does, however, add some complexity to the model. Moreover, there is a runtime penalty: the neural network makes slower predictions due to the extra computations required at each layer. **Fortunatley, it's often possible to fuse the BN layer with the previous layer, after training, thereby avoiding the runtime penalty.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find that training is rather slow, because each epoch takes much more time when you use Batch Normalization. This is usually counterbalanced by the fact that convergence is much faster with BN, so it will take fewer epochs to reach the same performance. All in all, *wall time* will usually be shorter."

    "As with most things with Keras, implementing Batch Normalization is simple and intuitive. Just add a BatchNormalization layer before or after each hidden layer's activation function, and optionally add a BN layer as well as the first layer in your model. The authors of the BN paper argued in favor of adding the BN layers before the activation functions, rather than after. You can experiment with this too to see which option works best on your dataset. To add the BN layers before the activation functions, you must remove the activation function from the hidden layers and add them as separate layers after the BN layers. Moreover, since a Batch Normalization layer includes one offset parameter per input, you can remove the bias term from the previous layer (just pass use_bias=False when creating it).\n",
    "\n",
    "The BatchNormalization class has quite a few hyperparameters you can tweak. The defaults will usually be fine, but you may occasionally need to tweak the momentum. This hyperparameter is used by the BatchNormalization layer when it updates the exponential moving averages; given a new value **v**. A good momentum value is typically close to 1; for example, 0.9, 0.99, or 0.999 (you want more 9s for larger datsets and smaller mini-batches). Another important hyperparameter is axis. It defaults to -1, meaning that by default it will normalize the last axis. When the input batch is 2D (i.e., the batch shape is [batch size, features]), this means that each input feature will be normalized based on the mean and standard deviation computer across all the instances in the batch. If we move the first BN layer before the Flatten layer, then the input batches will be #D, with shape [batch size, height, width]; therefore, the BN layer will computer 28 means and 28 standard deviations (1 per column of pixels, computed across all instances in the batch and across all rows in the column), and it will normalize all pixels in a given column using the same mean and standard deviation. There will also be just 28 sclare parameters and 28 shift parameters. If instead you still want to treat each of the 784 pixels independently, then you should set axis=[1, 2].\n",
    "\n",
    "BatchNormalization has become one of the most-used layers in deep neural networks, to the point that it is often omitted in the diagrams, as it is assumed that BN is added after every layer. But a recent paper may change this assumption: by using a novel *fixed-update* weight initialization technique. The authors managed to traing a very deep neural network (10,000 layers!) without BN, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex image classification tasks. As this is bleeding-edge research, however, you may want to wait for additional research to confirm this finding before you drop Batch Normalization."

    "Another popular technique to mitigate the exploding gradients problem is to clip the gradients during backpropagation so that they never exceed some threshold. **This is called *Gradient Clipping*. This technique is most often used in recurrent neural networks**, as Batch Normalization is tricky to use in RNNs. For other types of networks, BN is usually sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimizer with a clipvalue=1.0 will clip every component of the gradient vector to a value between -1.0 and 1.0. For instance, if the original gradient vector is [0.9, 100.0], it points mostly in the direction of the second axis; but once you clip it by value, you get [0.9, 1.0], which points roughly in the diagonal between the two axes. In practice, this approach works well. If you want to ensure that Gradient Clipping does not change the direction of the gradient vector, you should clip by norm by setting clipnorm instead of clipvalue. This will clip the whole gradient if its $l_{2}$ norm is greater than the threshold you picked.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you set clipnorm=1.0, then the vector [0.9, 100.0] will be clipped to [0.00899964, 0.9999595], preserving its orientation but almost eliminating the first component. You can track the size of the gradients using TensorBoard.\n",

However, it turns out that transfer learning does not work very well with small dense networks, presumably because small networks learn few patterns, and dense networks learn very specific patterns, which are unlikely to be useful in other tasks.\n",

    "Momentum optimization cares a great deal about what previous gradients were: at each iteration, it subtracts the local gradient from the *momentum vector* **m** (multiplied by the learning rate $\\eta$), and it updates the weights by adding the momentum vector. In other words, the gradient is used for acceleration, not for speed. To simulate some sort of friction mechanism and prevent the momentum from growing too large, the algorithm introduces a new hyperparameter $\\beta$, called the momentum, which must be set between 0 (high friction) and 1 (no friction). A typical momentum value is 0.9. This allows momentum optimization to escape from plateaus much faster than Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the momentum, the optimizer may overshoot a bit, then come back, overshoot again, and oscillate like this many times before stabilizing at the minimum. This is one of the reasons it's good to have a bit of friction in the system: it gets rid of these oscillations and thus speeds up convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The one drawback of momentum optimization is that it adds yet another hyperparameter to tune. However, the momentum value of 0.9 usually works well in practice and almost always goes faster than regular Gradient Descent.**"

In short, Adam scales down the parameter updates by the $l_{2}$ norm of the time-decayed gradients (recall that hte $l_{2}$ norm is the square root of the sum of squares). AdaMax, introduced in the same paper as Adam, replaces the $l_{2}$ norm with the $l_{\\infty}$ norm (a fancy way of saying the max). Specifically, it replaces step 2 in Equation 11-8 with the max of the time-decayed gradients. In practice, this can make AdaMax more stable than Adam, but it really depends on the dataset and in general Adam performs better. But AdaMax can be tried if there are problems with Adam <br>\n",

After *s* more steps, it is down to $\\large{\\frac{\\eta_{0}}{3}}$, and so on.** As you can see, this schedule first drops quickly, then more and more slowly.

    "5. ***1cycle scheduling***<br>\n",
    "    Contrary to the other approaches, *1cycle* starts by increasing the initial learning rate $\\eta_{0}$, growing linearly up to $\\eta_{1}$ halfway through training. Then it decreases the learning rate linearly down to $\\eta_{0}$ again during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs by dropping the rate down by several orders of magnitude (still linearly). The maximum learning rate $\\eta_{1}$ is chosen using the same appraoch we used to find the optimal learning rate, and the initial learning rate $\\eta_{0}$ is chosen to be roughly 10 times lower. When using a momentum, we start with a high momentum first (e.g., 0.95), then drop it down to a lower momentum during the first half of training (e.g., down to 0.85 linearly), and then bring it back up to the maximum value (0.95) during the second half of training, finishing the last few epochs with that maximum value. **This approach was shown by the publishing author to be faster and reach better performance than other scheduling techniques.** For example, on the popular CIFAR10 image dataset, this approach reached 91.9% validation accuracy in just 100 epochs, instead of 90.3% accuracy in 800 epochs through a standard approach.\n",

    "The LearningRateScheduler will update the optimizer's learning_rate attribute at the beginning of each epoch. Updating the learning rate once per epoch is usually enough, but if you want it to be updated more often, for example at every step, you can always write your own callback. Updating the learning rate at every step makes sense if there are many steps per epoch. Alternatively, you can use the tf.keras.optimizers.schedules approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The schedule function can optionally take the current learning rate as a second argument, which means the decay now starts at the beginning of epoch 0, instead of epoch 1. This implementation relies on the optimizer's initial learning rate, so make sure to set it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you save a model, the optimizer and its learning rate get saved along with it. This means that with this new schedule function, you could just load a trained model and continue training where it left off, not problem. Things are not so simple if your schedule function uses the epoch argument, however: the epoch does not get saved and it gets reset to 0 every time you call the fit() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For performance scheduling, use the ReduceLROnPlateau callback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Laslty, tf.keras offers an alternative way to implement learning rate scheduling: define the learning rate using one of the schedules available in tf.keras.optimizers.schedules, the pass this learning rate to any optimizer. This approach updates the learning rate at each step rather than at each epoch. This is nice and simple, plus when you save the model, the learning rate and its schedule (including its state) get saved as well. This approach, however, is not part of the Keras API; it is specific to tf.keras.\n",

    "*Dropout* is one of the most popular regularization techniques for deep neural networks. Even state-of-the-art neural networks get a 1-2% accuracy boost simply by adding dropout. It is a fairly simple algorithm: at every training step, every neuron (including the input neurons, but always excluding the output neurons) has a probability *p* of being temporarily \"dropped out\", meaning it will be entirely ignored during this training step, but it may be active during the next step. **The hyperparameter *p* is called the *dropout rate*, and it is typically set between 10% and 50%: closer to 20-30% in recurrent neural nets, and closer to 40-50% in convolutional neural networks.** After training, neurons don't get dropped anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "Would a company perform better if its employees were told to toss a coin every morning to decide whether or not to go to work? Well, who knows, perhaps it would! The company would be forced to adapt its organization; it could not rely on any single person to work the coffee machine or perform any other critical tasks, so this expertise would have to be spread across several people. Employees would have to learn to cooperate with many of their coworkers, not just a handful of them. This company would become much more resilient. It's unclear if whether this idea would actually work for companies, but it certainly does for neural networks. They end up being less sensitive to slight changes in the inputs. In the end, you get a more robust network that generalizes better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to understand the power of dropout is to realize that a unique neural network is generated at each training step. Once you have run 10,000 training steps, yo uhave essentially trained 10,000 different neural networks. The resulting neural network can be seen as an averaging ensemble of all these smaller networks. In general, you can usually apply dropout only to the neurons in the top 1-3 layers, excluding the output layer, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one small but important technical detail: we need to multiply each input connection weight by the *keep probability* (1 - p) after training. Alternatively, we can divide each neuron's output by the keep probability during training. This is a consequence of the fact that during testing, a neuron that was not dropped out will be connected to more inputs than if all neurons were present. This artifically increases the input weight assigned to that neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement dropout using Keras, you can use the keras.layers.Dropout layer. During training, it randomly drops some inputs (setting them to 0) and divides the remaining inputs by the keep probability. After training, it does nothing at all; it just passes the inputs to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Since dropout is only active during training, comparing the training loss and the validation loss can be misleading. In particular, a model may be overfitting the training set and yet have simliar training and validation losses. So make sure you evaluate the training loss without dropout (e.g., after training).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you observe that the model is overfitting, you can increase the dropout rate. Conversely, you should try decreasing the dropout rate for large layers, and reduce it for small ones. Moreover, many state-of-the-art architectures only use dropout after the last hidden layer, so you may want to try this if full dropout is too strong.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout does tend to significantly slow down convergence, but it usually results in a much better model when tuned properly. So, it is generally well worth the extra time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to regularize a self-normalizing network based on the SELU activation function, you should use *alpha dropout*: this is a variant of dropout that preserves the mean and standard deviation of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yarin Gal and Zoubin Ghaharamani published a paper in 2016 adding a few more good reasons to use dropout:\n",
    "1. First, the paper established a profound connection between dropout networks and approximate Bayesian inference, giving dropout a solid mathematical justification.\n",
    "2. Second, the authors introduced a powerful technique called *Monte Carlo Dropout*, which can boost the performance of any trained dropout model without having to retrain it or even modify it at all, provides a much better measure of the model's uncertainty, and is also amazingly simple to implement."

    "The configuration in the first DataFrame work fine in most cases, however do not consider these defaults as hard rules! The second is a good default for a simple stack of desne layers. Don't forget to normalize the input features! You should also try to reuse parts of a pretrained neural network if you can find one that solves a similar problem, or use unsupervised pretraining if you have a lot of unlabeled data, or use pretraining on an auxiliary task if you ahve a lot of labeled data for a similar task. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the previous guidelines should cover most cases, here are some exceptions:\n",
    "1. If you need a sparse model, you can use $l_{1}$ regularization (and optionally zero out the tiny weights after training). If you need an even sparser model, you can use the TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit. This will break self-normalization, so you should use the default configuration in this case.\n",
    "2. If you need a low-latency model (one that performs lightning-fast predictions), you may need to use fewer layers, fold the Batch Normalization layers in the previous layers, and possibly use a faster activation function such as leaky ReLU or just ReLU. Having a sparse model will also help. Finally, you may want to reduce the float precision from 32 bits to 16 or even 8 bits. Again, check out TF-MOT\n",
    "3. If you are building a risk-sensitive application, or inference latency is not very important in your application, you can use MC Dropout to boost performance and get more reliable probability estimates, along with uncertainty estimates."

Concretely, this means that all the neurons in any given layer will always have the same weights. It's like having just one neuron per layer, and much slower.

    "Yes, dropout slows down training. Since the dropout layer are inactivated after training is finished inference speed is not impacted. For MC Dropout, however, the dropout layers are still active after training is complete, so inference time scales linearly with the amount of samples."

    "Yes, dropout does slow down training, in general roughly by a factor of two. However, it has no impact on inference speed since it is only turned on during training. MC Dropout is exactly like dropout during training, but it is still active during inference, so each inference is slowed down slightly. More importantly, when using MC Dropout you generally want to run inference 10 times or more to get better predictions. This means that making predictions is slowed down by a factor of 10 or more."

The dataset is composed of 60,000 32x32 pixel color images (50k for training, 10k for testing) with 10 classes, so you'll need a softmax output layer with 10 neurons. **Remember to search for the right learning rate each time you change the model's architecture or hyperparameters.**\n",
