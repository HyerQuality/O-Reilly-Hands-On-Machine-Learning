    "*Artificial Nerual Networks* (ANNs) are Machine Learning models inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brains.  ANNs are at the very core of Deep Learning. They are versatile, powerful, and scalable, making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex Machine Learning tasks such as classifying billions of images, powering speech recognition services, recommending the best videos to watch to hundreds of millions of users every day, or learning to beat the world champion at a game of Go.\n",

    "The early successes of ANNs led to widespread belief that we would soon be conversing with truly intelligent machines.  When it became clear in the 1960's that this promise would go unfulfilled, funding flew elsewhere, and ANNs entered a long winter.  In the early 1980s, new architectures were invented and better training techniques were developed, sparking a revival of interest in *cnnectionism* (the study of neural networks).  But progress was slow, and by the 1990s other powerful Machine Learning techniques were invented, such as Support Vector Machines.  These techniques seemed to offer better results and stronger theoretical foundations than ANNs, so once again the study of neural networks was put on hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now witnessing yet another wave of interest in ANNs, and this time is different.\n",
    "* There are now a huge quantity of data available to train neural networks, and ANNs frequently outperform other ML techniques on very large and complex problems.\n",
    "* The tremendous increase in computing power since the 1990s now makes it possible to train large neural networks in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "* The training algorithms have been improved.\n",
    "* ANNs seem to have entered a virtuous cirle of funding and progress."
