    "Reading huge datasets efficiently is not the only difficulty: the data also needs to be preprocessed, usually normalized. Moreover, it is not always composed strictly of convenient numerical fields: there may be text features, categorical features, and so on. These need to be encoded, for example using one-hot encoding, bag-of-words encoding, or _embeddings_ (as we will see, an embedding is a trainable dense vector that represents a category or token). One option to handle all this preprocessing is to write your own custom preprocessing layers. Another is to use the standard preprocessing layers provided by Keras."

This array tells TensorFlow not only the default value for each column, but also what number of columns and their types. In this example, we tell it that all feature columns are floats and that missing values should default to 0, but we provide an empty array of tf.float32 as the default value for the last column (the target): the array tells TensorFlow that this column contains floats, but that there is no default value, so it will raise an exception if it encounters the missing value.\n",

We then do the same for the target value (this makes it a 1D tensor array with a single value, rather than a scalar tensor).\n",

The following example says we are using version 3 of the protobuf format, and it specifies that each Person object may (optionally) have a name of type string, an id of type int32, and zero or more email fields, each of type string. The numbers 1, 2, and 3 are the field identifiers: they will be used in each record's binary representation. Once you have a definition in a .proto file, you can compile it. This requires protoc, the protobuf compiler, to generate access classes in Python. Fortuantely, TensorFlow does include special protobuf definitions for which it provies parsing operations."

Common words like 'and' will have a large value in most texts, even though they are usually the least interesting (e.g. in the text 'more and more basketball' the word 'basketball' is clearly the most important, precisely because it is not a very frequent word).\n",
    "\n",
    "__So, the word ccounts should be normalized in a way that reduces the importance of frequent words. A common way to do this is to divide each word count by the log of the total number of training instances in which the word appears.__ This technique is called _Term-Frequency x Inverse-Document-Frequency_ (TF-IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's imagine that the words 'and', 'basketball', and 'more' appear respectively in 200, 10 and 100 text instances in the training set: in this case, the final vector will be [ 1/log(200), 0/log(10), 2/log(100) ], which is aproximately equal to [0.19, 0., 0.43]. The TextVectorization layer will (likely) have an option to perform TF-IDF."
